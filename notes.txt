Begin React:
============

npm i -g create-react-app

create a new react app:
=======================
create-react-app client

cd client

npm start


Proxy:
======
in package.json of client(react)
add "proxy":"localhost:5000" just before the last }

this is to call the APIs without the hostname

Concurrently:
=============
This is to run the client and the server simultaneously

install concurrently

add the following in the server's package.json

  "scripts": {
    "client-install": "npm install --prefix client",
    "start": "node app.js",
    "server": "nodemon app.js",
    "client":"npm start --prefix client",
    "dev":"concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\""
  },


Run client and server concurrently:
====================================

npm run dev

Day2:
=====

class name should always start in upper case
How to use properties
how to passs properties from parent to child component
State, setState
Onchange and Submit events


Day3:
====

-Change port of react application - modify start in package.json
  "start": "set PORT=80 && react-scripts start",
-Added bootstrap
-Made the application responsive
-Added buttons to the timer - Resume, Pause, Stop
-ToDo List -> Added functionality to remove the list onClick
-diff bet onclick={} and onclick={()=>}, in the latter 'this' will be bound - https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html
-This is not React-specific behavior; it is a part of how functions work in JavaScript. Generally, if you refer to a method without () after it, such as onClick={this.handleClick}, you should bind that method.
